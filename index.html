            <h2>Reasons to learn Web Development</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't need a college education to break into the field. (Although having a CS degree definitely
                    won't hurt your chances of getting hired!)</li>
                <li>A totally average web developer can expect to make around $75,580 dollars (USD) a year.<br><a

                <li>Employment for web developers in projected to grow 15% by 2026, which is much faster than the
                    average for all occupations.<br><a

                <li>Want to work from home? A career in web development gives you a great chance at being able to work
                    remotely with 11.1% of web developers from a 2017 Stack Overflow developer survey reporting they
                    work from home full-time. Another 9.4% report they work from home less than half the time, but more
                    than once a week.</li>
                <li>A career in web development fits any type of person well. Are you super creative? How about learning
                    CSS and JavaScript well and letting your creative juices flow. More of a logic person? Master Python
                    and let logic prevail.</li>

            <p>
                All of the preceding is fine and good, but there is just so much information out there online. Everyone
                has a different opinion on how to start learning web development and which language to start learning
                first. Well, I can't answer that for you, but I can give you some advice on which language you might
                want to learn first as well as how to get started learning it. So without any further adieu, on to the
                meat of the article.

            </header>

            <p>
                Front-end development, or client-side development, is all about style and user experience. If you are a
                creative person and not too great with logic, you probably will want to focus on front-end languages and
                technologies. Unlike back-end development, your choices of languages are somewhat limited for the
                front-end. Front-end developers primarily deal with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are some slight
                deviations from those 3 (I'm talking compiled languages, which we will touch on a bit farther down.),
                but in the end it all boils down to those 3. Also unlike back-end development, to become a front-end
                developer you must learn, at the very minimum, at least HTML and CSS. That is just the basics for
                front-end development though. If you really want to make a career out of front-end development, you had
                better learn JavaScript as well. Enough with the filler though, let us move on to the languages of the
                front-end.

                    HTML is the structure of every single website you have ever visited, including this one. Don't

                    on the internet and do the same thing and you will see those HTML elements and many more.

                    what programming language to learn first for web development? Well, if you want to become a
                    front-end developer (or really a web developer in general) than you have to start with HTML. Instead
                    of being a programming language, it is what is called a markup language and it is a web standard.
                    Meaning if you want to be a web developer, than you have to learn HTML. There is no way around it.

                    Hell, you could slap together an entire website only using 3 or 4 different HTML elements. It
                    wouldn't be the prettiest or most functional website, but it would be a website.

                    CSS is the style of every website you have ever visited online. If the internet was a house, HTML
                    would be the support and structure, or the 2x4's and drywall. As well as it's cement foundation.
                    Then CSS would be the houses style. It would be the paint, furnishings, wallpaper, and anything else
                    you would consider a visual style. CSS pretties up your HTML and makes it nice to look at.

                    Instead of being a programming language, it is just a stylesheet or rules for your website. Also,
                    like HTML, CSS is a web standard. Meaning that if you want to be a front-end web developer, than you
                    had better learn CSS.

                    I probably could have just copy and pasted everything from the HTML section here. Anywho, you should
                    learn CSS because, as a front-end developer, you will deal with CSS on a daily (or even hourly)
                    basis. Plus, CSS is fun. There are so many different things you can do with it.

                    I could have rated the difficulty of CSS in a couple different ways, but I chose to rate it on how
                    difficult it is to get the basics down. Mastering CSS is a bit more difficult because there is just
                    so much you can do with it.

                    JavaScript is our first actual programming language! JavaScript gives you the power to make your
                    websites dynamic. It can control, manipulate, and change all of your HTML and CSS content. You can
                    animate your website with JavaScript (You can also animate with CSS, but not to the same degree as
                    with JavaScript.). Just about any website you've ever visited that has an element of interactivity
                    to it has been created with JavaScript. JavaScript is King on the internet. It is one of the most,
                    if not THE most, versatile programming languages around today. Just to keep up with our house
                    analogy for internet technologies, JavaScript would be like the electricity coursing through the
                    wires of the house. So, we have the structure and foundation of the house made from HTML. All the
                    decorations, furnishings, and paint (All the style) of the house is CSS. JavaScript powers it all
                    though. JavaScript makes the house dynamic by giving it parts that can move and change.

                    If your goal is to get paid to be a front-end developer, than you had better get good at JavaScript.
                    Sure, you can create some pretty good looking websites with only HTML and CSS, but making websites
                    dynamic and interactive is what is going to get you paid. Back to the house analogy once again. You
                    can certainly build a house with only the structure, foundation (HTML), furnishings, paint, and
                    decorations (CSS). (Just for the record, websites built with only HTML and CSS are called static
                    sites. They are static because they don't have any real moving parts to them) Is anyone going to
                    want to visit that house though? I would think they would want to go to the house with electricity.
                    The house that has air conditioning, heat, and T.V. The house with JavaScript.

                    JavaScript is considered a fairly easy language to learn and is often recommended as a first language for a beginner to learn.  This is because JavaScript is generally pretty forgiving with hoe you write your code.  This can be viewed as a positive or a negative to different people.  Some developers like how flexible and forgiving JavaScript can be as it makes everything a bit easier.  On the other hand, some developers feel like that flexibility and forgiveness can lead to sloppy code.  Also, if your writing a large application, it can lead to hard to find bugs in your program by breaking other bits of code down the line that may rely on the sloppy code JavaScript allowed you to write.  There are solutions to this problem, some of which we will cover in the compiled (to JavaScript) section.

                <p>
                    Compiled to JavaScript means that you can write your code in a different programming language, and at runtime it will compile your code to JavaScript.  Basically it's just a way to write JavaScript without writing JavaScript.

                <p>
                    As we covered in the JavaScript section, many developers don't like how forgiving plain JavaScript can be.  A language that is compiled to JavaScript can fix that and make you write cleaner more maintainable code.  Languages that compile to JavaScript can also give you different features and benefits such as type-safety and inheritance.

                <p>
                    Python is one of the most popular programming languages around today.  This is thanks to it's simple syntax, which looks almost like written English.  Python, along with JavaScript and Ruby (Which we will get to shortly), is commonly mentioned and recommended as a good first language for a aspiring new programmer to learn.  Since Python is not a scripting language, like JavaScript, it has to be used as a back-end language to add logic to your websites.

                <p>
                    As I previously mentioned, Python is among the easiest programming languages to learn for a beginner.  It has easy to understand syntax that almost looks like written English.  Python also recommended to new programmers because of it's philosophy of "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it." as written in the<a href="https://zen-of-python.info" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zen of Python</a>.  This philosophy forces new developers to learn the right way of doing something as opposed to many other programming languages which have many ways of doing the same thing.

                    Some more reasons to choose Python as a first programming language are:
                </span>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It is used by a lot of companies.<br><br>
                        Google<br>Facebook<br>Instagram<br>Spotify<br>Quora<br>Netflix<br>Dropbox<br>
                        That is just a few of the big companies that use Python a lot in their services.  So knowing Python will make you very hireable.

                    <li>
                        The average starting salary for a back-end developer with Python skills is $65,642 dollars (USD) a year.<br><span>According to <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Web_Developer/Salary/89ec65af/Python" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Payscale.com</a></span>

                    <li>
                        Since Python is such a popular language, there is a butt load of free resources available online to learn from.

                    <li>
                        Also, since Python is such a popular language, it has a very large and active community online.  So, when you get stuck on a problem in your code, it is much easier to get help from someone online than with many other languages.

                programme. Other than HTML and CSS, most languages have at least somewhat similar syntax, and rules, and
                methods. Once you learn one language well, you will be able to pick up your next language quicker. Than
                the next language you'll learn quicker than that, and so on and so forth.
